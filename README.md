# Game 1 -> Guess a Number
Our first game allows the user to input a number between 1 and 10 in the console. If the user guesses the same number as the computer is thinking, they win!



# Game 2 -> Rock, Paper, Scissors
Our second game is a classic game of rock, paper, scissors. Each game the computer will pick one of the three choices, rock, paper or scissors at random. The user will also input one of the three choices to see if they can beat the computer.
